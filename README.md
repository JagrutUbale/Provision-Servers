Provisioning Servers

##Code for provisioning the two platforms.
<p>The code to provision DigitalOcean and AWS EC2 is in the two files</p>
* [do.js](https://github.ncsu.edu/vbhat/HW1/blob/master/do.js)
* [aws.js](https://github.ncsu.edu/vbhat/HW1/blob/master/aws.js)

<p>To automate the process of creating the two servers and displaying their IP Adresses simultaneously, I have created a bash script to run the commands:</p>
* [script](https://github.ncsu.edu/vbhat/HW1/blob/master/script)

To run the programs do the following:

		npm install
		bash script
