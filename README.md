## Provisioning Servers

## Code for provisioning the two platforms.

<p>The code to provision DigitalOcean and AWS EC2 is in the two files</p>

* [do.js](https://github.ncsu.edu/vbhat/HW1/blob/master/do.js)
* [aws.js](https://github.ncsu.edu/vbhat/HW1/blob/master/aws.js)

<p>To automate the process of creating the two servers and displaying their IP Adresses simultaneously, I have created a bash script to run the commands:</p>

* [script](https://github.ncsu.edu/vbhat/HW1/blob/master/script)

To run the programs do the following:

		npm install
		bash script 
	
## Configuration management of repo.
Instead of uploading the Node_modules folder there is package.json file to resolve the dependencies of the project.

* [Package.json](https://github.ncsu.edu/vbhat/HW1/blob/master/package.json)
